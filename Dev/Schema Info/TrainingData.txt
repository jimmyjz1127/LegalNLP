The policy states that between x:xx time cars cannot be parked in certain lots and between x:xx time cars cannot be parked in other certain lots due to snow removal from all the parking lots. \n\nAfter the storm my wife, who works from home some days, was not available to move her car during these very specific times for plowing. When she was able to get outside and move her car she was advised by representatives of the property management company that she gets a pass this time but next time they will fine us $50 if they have to text us to remind us to move our car and $100 if the car isn\u2019t moved in what they called a \u201creasonable timeframe\u201d. \n\nNowhere in my signed lease does it mention anything about moving cars for snow removal or reference any policies regarding snow removal or fines. They posted the policy well after our signed lease and did not request any confirmation of receiving the policy or signature stating that we agree to the policy.",
